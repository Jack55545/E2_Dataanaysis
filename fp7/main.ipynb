    "The purpose of this Final Project is to identify the factors that influence coffee sensory evaluation and overall consumer preference.\n",
    "The key dependent variable (DV) is Liking, measured on a 1–5 scale, indicating how much the taster liked the coffee sample.\n",
    "Key independent variables (IVs) include:\n",
    "* Brew temperature condition (e.g., “87-1.0-16”, “87-1.25-20”, etc.)\n",
    "* TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)\n",
    "* PE (Extraction)\n",
    "* Dose (amount of coffee grounds)\n",
    "* Position (order in which the sample was presented within a session)\n",
    "* Sensory attributes (binary indicators, 0 or 1), such as:\n",
    "* Fruity\n",
    "* Floral\n",
    "* Earthy\n",
    "* Nutty\n",
