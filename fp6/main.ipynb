    "The purpose of this Final Project is to identify the factors that influence coffee sensory evaluation and overall consumer preference.\n",

    "Key independent variables (IVs) include:\n",
    "* Brew temperature condition (e.g., “87-1.0-16”, “87-1.25-20”, etc.)\n",
    "* TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)\n",
    "* PE (Extraction)\n",
    "* Dose (amount of coffee grounds)\n",
    "* Position (order in which the sample was presented within a session)\n",
    "* Sensory attributes (binary indicators, 0 or 1), such as:\n",
    "* Fruity\n",
    "* Floral\n",

    "From the original dataset containing 47 explanatory variables, we focus on a subset of features with data types that are straightforward to handle and interpret in a machine-learning setting.\n",
    "Specifically, we use the following variables:\n",
    "Dose, Grind, Brew Mass, Percent Extraction, pH, Volume, Brew Temperature, Pour Temp, 90Sec Temp, Flavor.intensity, Acidity, Mouthfeel, and the binary flavor notes Fruit, Bitter, Astringent, Sour, and Sweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, results from the FP4 analysis suggested that Flavor.intensity has a nonlinear (approximately quadratic) relationship with overall liking.\n",
    "To account for this effect while keeping the model interpretable, we include a squared term for Flavor.intensity in the learning process, while all other features enter the model linearly."
